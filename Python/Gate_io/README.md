## Dependencies
- requests

## Usage
When running the `API_Gate_io.py` (`API_Kukoin.py`) file, data will be fetched from the exchange at 1-second intervals. This interval can be configured in the `config.py` file located in the same directory.

To fetch data from the exchange once, import the `get_data_from_endpoint` function from `API_Gate_io.py` (`API_Kukoin.py`) and just call it.
